# whaleforecast 🐳

**whaleforecast 🐳** (Walvorhersage) is about predicting the outcome of the German federal election 2025 using cross-validated time-series prediction based on data such as newspapers, social media, and public opinion. It's not a very original idea, but I don't know a single election forecasting organization that does this.
